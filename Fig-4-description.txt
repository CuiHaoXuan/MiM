A test is given to verify the function correctness of MPTCP in Android-x86-nougat. As can be seen in Fig. 4, we create two 
VirtualBox instances for Android-x86-nougat, call them lineage-1 and lineage-2 respectively. Both lineage-1 and lineage-2 have two 
network interfaces, namely eth0 and eth1. Network topology is generated by NS-3 script [2] written in C++.  Window W1 refers to 
lineage-1, windows W2 and W3 refer to the same VirtualBox instance, namely lineage-2, window W4 refers to NS-3. We first start NS-3, 
then run command nc in lineage-1 to make it as a file server, next run command nc in lineage-2 to download file chrome.apk (64MB) 
from lineage-1. After downloading the file, we run command ls in lineage-2 (W3) to find that the size of the downloaded file is the 
same to the size of the file in server (W1). Window W4 shows that file chrome.apk is transmitted through two paths at the same time. 
The test result show that MPTCP is successfully ported on Android-x86-nougat.
