Natural disasters, e.g. earthquakes, floods, tsunamis, etc., often cause breakdown or interruption of communications infrastructure. To improve the efficiency of search-and-rescue, it is necessary to provide normal communication among peoples or MSDs. In recent years, smartphones are more powerful and can be used to construct MANETs. In addition, UAV cluster is a research hotspot. UAV cluster can be also used to effectively carry out reconnaissance and surveillance in disaster areas. However, due to MSDs move in and out of network coverage areas and the network topology constantly changing, there are the well-known issues exhibited by MANETs, that is, frequent disconnections and failed transmissions. Therefore, we use MPTCP to solve the issues.
